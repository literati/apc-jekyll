                              <p>Romantic and nationalistic topics abound in this September issue of Burton’s Gentleman’s Magazine. Two different pieces romanticizing the naval engagements of the War of 1812, a celebratory profile of playwright-novelist Richard Penn Smith, and a review of letters from a Revolutionary War era woman illustrate the inclination to craft national identity from war memory and hero-worship.  Another article helps to envision a history of ancient America in recounting early Viking expeditions to Vineland (possibly North America).  Burton’s “A Rummage in my Old Bureau” expresses nostalgia at the disappearance of the heroic generation of Revolution-era leaders as a “nonegenarian” sifts through mementoes of a long American life. Botany and nationalism come together neatly in two American guide books for flowers and fruit, both of which were reviewed by Poe in this issue. One of Poe’s greatest gothic tales, “The Fall of the House of Usher,” fits comfortably alongside several melancholy poems about death and loss.</p>
