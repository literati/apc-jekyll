Poe on January 3, after Poe had written most of the reviews for the January issue and had provisionally arranged the contents. White was, however, still discussing with Poe on January 17 how much of his &quot;Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym&quot; could be included in the January issue (<em>Poe Log</em> 239). In assuming Poe&#8217;s duties, White was thus obliged to work directly with the printer to manage page layout and spacing--which may have contributed to the delay. The March issue of 1837 was the first to identify White officially as editor and proprietor.<strong><br /><br /></strong>Approximate publication date: After January 26, 1837.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The issue thus appeared over a month late.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></li></ul></li><li><h2 id="works-cited">Works Cited</h2><ul><li>Dwight Thomas and David K.

In his letters, Thomas White claims to have dismissed Poe for irregular behavior (probably intoxication). However, White also faced a cash shortage in the aftermath of Andrew Jackson&#8217;s Specie Circular&#8212;a topic that James Kirke Paulding takes up in this issue&#8217;s &quot;A Visit to My Native Village After an Absence of Thirty Years.&quot; The contents of the January 1837<em>Messenger</em> indeed reflect a range of antebellum issues. Scott&#8217;s &quot;Rights of Authors&quot; broaches the copyright issue that would a few years later obsess Poe. Nationalist pride figures in Thomas Jefferson&#8217;s letter affirming the superiority of American republican government to British monarchy. But we also see hints of sectional mistrust in Abel Parker Upshur&#8217;s review of Nathaniel Beverley Tucker&#8217;s<em>The Partisan Leader</em>, an 1836 novel that prefigures a civil war between North and South. Poe&#8217;s &quot;Pym&quot; initiates a tale of adventure at sea but also resonates with his own review of J.N. Reynolds&#8217;s call for a US &quot;South-Sea Expedition.&quot; Lauding the proposal by Reynolds, Poe underscores the potential scientific and commercial benefits to the nation. Elsewhere, Horatio King&#8217;s &quot;The Indian Captive as Related by a First Settler&quot; tells of a white boy captured in a border attack, preserved by a loyal Indian, and at last restored to his family. Other contents similarly appeal to sentimentalism or to religious piety.</li></ul></li></ul><div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol><li id="fn1"><p>Poe Log:<a href="http://www.eapoe.org/papers/misc1921/tplgc04b.htm"></a><a href="http://www.eapoe.org/papers/misc1921/tplgc04b.htm"><em>http://www.eapoe.org/papers/misc1921/tplgc04b.htm</em></a><a href="#fnref1">&#8617;</a></li><li id="fn2"><p><em>SLM</em> usually strove to put out issues &quot;on or very near the 20<sup>th</sup> of each month preceding the one for which it was dated&quot; (Minor 62).<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=eJ69RIaKQHkC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;lpg=PA61&amp;dq=%22A+Visit+to+My+Native+Village+After+an+Absence+of+Thirty+Years%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3onjBKW7Bd&amp;sig=Z3pO0Z8UoMIP2jVYWjGDcziE4PI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_DANVIibLI-1ogSs_IEw&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAg%23v=onepage&amp;q=%22A%20Visit%20to%20My%20Native%20Village%20After%20an%20Absence%20of%20Thirty%20Years%22&amp;f=false"></a><a href="#fnref2">&#8617;</a></li></ol></div>

          antebellum American culture—that can be discerned in the issue. These threads are a starting point, a testing ground for ways to produce more computationally-derived key features of each issue. That more expansive searchability will emerge as
          we place OCR-corrected digital files and embedded metadata behind the page images now usable.</p>

        <p>All of the magazines in our archive can be located in some form in other online databases, but nowhere else are they connected together seamlessly, enabling a user to explore the deeply interesting connection between Poe’s remarkable poems, tales,
          essay, and reviews, on the one hand, and, on the other, the range of subjects that typified antebellum American experience. This resource illuminates the turbulent decade of nation-building between the mid-1830s and mid-1840s, when conflicts
          over slavery and territorial expansion complicated cultural nationalism and fueled notions of US "Manifest Destiny." “Poe’s Magazines” exhibits periodical fare from four magazines representing three cities (Richmond, Philadelphia, and New York)
          and four distinct historical moments (each corresponding to a different presidential administration). In the articles, essays, tales, poetry, reviews, and illustrations promulgated in these magazines, one acquires a rich sense of the issues
          and controversies that engaged the denizens of Jacksonian America as well as the literary and aesthetic modes that defined popular taste.</p>

        <p>Currently, our prototype features one month’s material from each of our four journals: the January 1837 <em>Southern Literary Messenger</em>, the September 1839 <em>Burton’s</em>, the May 1842 <em>Graham’s</em>, and the five weekly issues comprising
          the November 1845 <em>Broadway Journal</em>. We selected these issues because they showcase original publications of Poe’s work and highlight important periods in his tenure as editor or on editorial staff. </p>

        <p>"Poe’s Magazines" forms part of the digital collection Poe’s Republic of Letters, which is itself part of a projected mosaic of linked sites devoted to Antebellum Print Culture. The team at Louisiana State University that is now constructing “Poe’s
          Magazines” consists of faculty in English, History, Philosophy and Religious Studies, Library and Information Sciences, Design, and Computer Science, as well as key staff members from the LSU Libraries, the Center for Computing Technology, and
          a cohort of graduate students in English, History, Library and Information Sciences, and Design.</p>
